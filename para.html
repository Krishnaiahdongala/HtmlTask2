       <p>A paragraph is a <a href="">series</a> of sentences that are <u>organized and coherent,</u> and are all related to a single <a href="">topic</a>. Almost every piece of writing you do that is longer than a few sentences should be organized into paragraphs. This is because paragraphs show a reader where the <strong>subdivisions</strong> of an essay begin and end, and thus help the reader see the organization of the essay and grasp its main points.

        Paragraphs can contain many different kinds of information. A paragraph could contain a series of brief examples or <ins>a single long illustration</ins> of a general point. It might describe a place, <abbr title="character">CH</abbr>, or process; narrate a series of events; compare or contrast two or more things; classify items into categories; or <mark> describe causes and effects.</mark> Regardless of the kind of information they contain, all paragraphs share certain characteristics.</p>
